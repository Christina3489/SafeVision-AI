# SafeVision-AI

Approach: The project aims to develop an AI-driven system for the detection of weapons, violent behaviors, and face-emotion detection in school environments. This is important for the safety of students and staff. 
 
Purpose: To enable the detection of a potentially threatening situation and interfere with the incidents before they occur. This will help in developing a safe environment for students and faculties, besides increasing incidents of casualties attributed to school shootings. 
 
Vision: Our vision is to make all educational institutions safe and free from violence, where AI would play an important role in protecting the students and faculties in the institutions, together with the general community, from armed attacks and aggressive behavior. 
 
Mission: The development of an undetectable, efficient, and reliable AI system using the most advanced image recognition and machine learning techniques is done to recognize weapons, violent activities, and emotional distress. This allows rapid intervention to reduce the chances of horrific events. 
 
Tactics: To develop cutting-edge algorithms for weapon detection, violence detection, and facial emotion analysis by fusion of neural networks and computer vision. The system will learn from continuous data from the real world to provide high accuracy and immediate responsiveness. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Use cases 
1.	Behavior Pattern Detection: This system plays a vital role in preventing violence in schools by identifying and addressing aggressive or suspicious behaviors before they escalate. 
Justification: The behavior pattern detection system significantly enhances safety for students and staff by allowing early intervention when potential threats are detected, thus fostering a more secure school environment. By leveraging advanced AI technology for real-time threat detection, this system has the potential for broader applications across various sectors, including public safety and security. Proactively managing behavioral issues contributes to a more controlled and safer school atmosphere. Culturally, it promotes vigilance and responsibility, encouraging a proactive stance on maintaining school safety. Economically, investing in behavior pattern detection helps reduce the financial burden of managing crises, medical treatments, and legal liabilities, providing long-term cost savings. 
2.	Face Image Emotion Analysis: This technology is crucial for identifying emotional distress in students through real-time facial analysis, allowing for timely intervention and support. 
Justification: This technology provides early support and intervention for students experiencing emotional difficulties, ensuring their safety and well-being. It advances AI applications in emotion recognition, with potential uses extending to healthcare, customer service, and security industries. By addressing emotional issues proactively, it contributes to a healthier and more supportive school environment. Culturally, it fosters a culture of empathy and early mental health intervention, reducing stigma and encouraging a supportive atmosphere. Economically, it lowers costs related to managing violent incidents and disruptions by addressing emotional issues before they escalate, thus enhancing the overall educational experience. 
3. Weapon Detection: Real-time weapons detection is crucial in preventing violence in schools, as harmful objects can be interjected prior to being used. 
Justification: Real-time weapon detection would directly protect students and staff by preventing weapons from entering the schools, thus increasing safety.This technology can be applied to various high-security areas beyond schools, including public events and transportation, revolutionizing security measures. It ensures a secure and controlled environment within schools, contributing to the safety of public spaces. Culturally, it promotes a culture of safety and trust within educational institutions, reassuring students and staff. Economically, it helps prevent the significant financial and emotional costs associated with violent incidents, making it a valuable investment in long-term safety and reducing the need for costly reactive security measures. 
     
Literature review 
Behavior Pattern Detection: Varol, G., Laptev, I., & Schmid, C. (2017). Long-term Temporal Convolutions for Action Recognition. This research explores behavior recognition using deep learning, which aligns with the project's aim of identifying early signs of distress or aggression. Detecting abnormal behaviors in real-time has proven valuable in security applications and public safety. 
Face Image Emotion Analysis: Mollahosseini, A., Hasani, B., & Mahoor, M. H. (2017). AffectNet: A Database for Facial Expression, Valence, and Arousal Computing in the Wild. This paper discusses facial emotion analysis in diverse environments, providing the foundation for emotion detection in schools, which can aid in preventing emotional distress from escalating into violence. 
Weapon Detection: Redmon, J., & Farhadi, A. (2018). YOLOv3: An Incremental Improvement. YOLO-based models, including YOLOv3 and YOLOv4, has high accuracy in object detection, such as weapons. Real-time detection and quick response are critical in reducing the impact of potential violent incidents in schools, directly supporting the project's weapon detection use case.
